Cloud native computing uses an open source software stack to deploy applications as microservices, 
packaging each part into its own container, and dynamically orchestrating those containers 
to optimize resource utilization. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) hosts critical 
components of those software stacks including Kubernetes, Fluentd, Linkerd, Prometheus, 
OpenTracing and gRPC; brings together the industry‚Äôs top developers, end users, and vendors; 
and serves as a neutral home for collaboration. CNCF is part of The Linux Foundation, 
a nonprofit organization. For more information about CNCF, please visit: https://cncf.io/.

CNCF encourages training companies to align their offerings to cover the contents of the
curriculum.  Training [partners](https://www.cncf.io/certification/training/) can purchase 
coupons for the CKA exam at a wholesale price to offer at the end of their training.

The latest curriculum can always be found at [https://github.com/cncf/curriculum](https://github.com/cncf/curriculum).

During the exam you are allowed be allowed to open **one** tab apart from the browser based terminal. You can open _any_ link under the [kubernetes.io](kubernetes.io) domain. Some links that will help during the exam are;

* [https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet)
* [https://discuss.kubernetes.io](https://discuss.kubernetes.io)
* [https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/)

If you are unsure of the spec or parameters of a yaml, always use `kubectl explain <resource>.<key>`.

## üõ† Pre-requisites

### kubectl

- [ ] Read and practice with **kubectl Cheat Sheet** - [https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/) - This page is an overview of the kubectl command. **NOTE:** This page can be referenced with your one other available tab.

These aliases will help save the precious time you have. Use these during your studies, so you are used to them on the day.

```sh
# Needed
alias k='kubectl'

# Optional
alias kgp='kubectl get pods'
alias kgs='kubectl get svc'
alias kgc='kubectl get componentstatuses'
alias kctx='kubectl config current-context'
alias kcon='kubectl config use-context'
alias kgc='kubectl config get-context'
```

### openssl/cfssl

- [ ] Read and use **OpenSSL command cheatsheet** - [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/openssl-command-cheatsheet-b441be1e8c4a/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/openssl-command-cheatsheet-b441be1e8c4a/) - When it comes to security-related tasks, like generating keys, CSRs, certificates, calculating digests, debugging TLS connections and other tasks related to PKI and HTTPS, you‚Äôd most likely end up using the OpenSSL tool.

## üìö Study

This is a list of some resoures I used to study for the exam.

### Read

- [ ] Read **Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) Study Guide** by Benjamin Muschko - https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/certified-kubernetes-administrator/9781098107215/ -  Exclusively on O'Reilly: Get more hands-on training and test your CKA exam readiness by working through the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) Exam Prep Labs playlist. This collection of 30 interactive labs provides hands-on training that enhances the exam prep provided by this study guide.

- [ ] Read **The Kubernetes Book** by Nigel Poulton - [THE KUBERNETES BOOK](https://nigelpoulton.com/books/)

- [ ] Read **Kubernetes: Up and Running, 3rd Edition** By Brendan Burns, Joe Beda, Kelsey Hightower, Lachlan Evenson - https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/kubernetes-up-and/9781098110192/

#### Additional Reading

> **Kubernetes Cheat Sheet ‚Äì 15 Kubectl Commands & Objects** - [https://spacelift.io/blog/kubernetes-cheat-sheet](https://spacelift.io/blog/kubernetes-cheat-sheet)

> **15 Kubernetes Best Practices Every Developer Should Know** - [https://spacelift.io/blog/kubernetes-best-practices](https://spacelift.io/blog/kubernetes-best-practices)

### Do

- [ ] Do **all** the tasks on [https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/) - This section of the Kubernetes documentation contains pages that show how to do individual tasks. A task page shows how to do a single thing, typically by giving a short sequence of steps.

- [ ] Do **kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way** - [https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way) - This tutorial walks you through setting up Kubernetes the hard way. This guide is not for people looking for a fully automated command to bring up a Kubernetes cluster.   Kubernetes The Hard Way is optimized for learning, which means taking the long route to ensure you understand each task required to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster.

- [ ] Do **Kubernetes The Hard Way On VirtualBox** - [https://github.com/mmumshad/kubernetes-the-hard-way](https://github.com/mmumshad/kubernetes-the-hard-way) - This tutorial is a modified version of the original developed by [Kelsey Hightower](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way). While the original one uses GCP as the platform to deploy kubernetes, we use VirtualBox and Vagrant to deploy a cluster on a local machine. If you prefer the cloud version, refer to the original one [here](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way)

### Courses

- [ ] Do **Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) with Practice Tests** course - [https://www.udemy.com/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/](https://www.udemy.com/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/) - Prepare for the Certified Kubernetes Administrators Certification with live practice tests right in your browser.

- [ ] Do **Kubernetes Deep Dive** course - [https://acloud.guru/learn/kubernetes-deep-dive](https://acloud.guru/learn/kubernetes-deep-dive) - Everything you need to know to start deploying and managing cloud-native applications on Kubernetes in the real world.

Cloud native computing uses an open source software stack to deploy applications as microservices, 
packaging each part into its own container, and dynamically orchestrating those containers 
to optimize resource utilization. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) hosts critical 
components of those software stacks including Kubernetes, Fluentd, Linkerd, Prometheus, 
OpenTracing and gRPC; brings together the industry’s top developers, end users, and vendors; 
and serves as a neutral home for collaboration. CNCF is part of The Linux Foundation, 
a nonprofit organization. For more information about CNCF, please visit: https://cncf.io/.

CNCF encourages training companies to align their offerings to cover the contents of the
curriculum.  Training [partners](https://www.cncf.io/certification/training/) can purchase 
coupons for the CKA exam at a wholesale price to offer at the end of their training.
